Inspirations:
-Silent Hill 4: A fixed Real room location with diversions into an Unreal dimension
-Fight club and Lorde's Royals: A nihilistic detachment from society exemplified by aesthetic life style
-Disco Elysium: ---
-World of horror: Interactive fiction and possibly episode based investigation of the supernatural.
-Dark Souls: The nostalgic, surreal and dreamlike detachment through time and space of the setting. Possibly the laconic and focused style to NPCs as well (they are part of the setting, no or small amounts of branching dialog)
-Final Fantasy Tactics: If there existed a fantasy world that was better than reality, why not choose it over the real world? 
-Sunset Boulevard: ---

Soundtrack:
-Morcheba - Blood like lemonade
-Bag Raiders - Shooting Stars 
-Droid Bishop and other retrowave

Description:
A protagonist wakes up in their bed. Their room is very sparse, with few if any decorations. The furniture and furnishings of the apartment are minimal and cheap. The main character has no job, has no family in town and no friends. The Protagonist was supposed to be evicted long ago but through a procedural mix up at the bank, they have not been. 

Outside their nondescript living space there exists movement and actions of other people, but since the protagonist has no connection to these, they are like the passing of cars outside a window: present but removed. The protagonist listens to the lives of the other people adjacent to them through the too-thin walls of the apartment. The protagonist never sees these people but may interact with them in the ethereal world

The lack of attachment to the world through any sort of schedule, purpose, obligation or interest has enabled the protagonist to transport themselves into the ethereal plane, which they access through their unplugged electric toaster.

The ethereal plane is a series of disconnected, fantastic, comic, terrifying, but over all surreal eventualities, stories advancing and parallelizing his own. In one journey they might be thrust into the apocalypse. In another they might be a factory worker finishing the icing of cakes. In another they are a parent undergoing a divorce. The protagonistâ€™s exploration of these stories and their interest perhaps advances as the game goes on, threatening to entice them or trap them forever in their confines. It is up to the player to decide whether this is a bad thing.    

"Failures" in the game present themselves as terminations of this fragile balance between the Real and Unreal worlds: Starting a job or being accepted by a group of friends might start the protagonist down a path where they immerse themselves in those aspects. The Real, with its immediacy dulls the imagination where the Unreal is no longer obtainable. The toaster just makes toast.

Likewise, fully committing to the Unreal necessitates a letting go of the last tether that binds oneself to the Real world. As such, it is a one way process. You can never come back to the Real world.

Inherent in the gameplay can be perhaps an exploration of these "failures" possibly through a (bleh) time loop, or possibly surreal lampshade of the whole Load/Save meta-mechanic.
