-Idea 1 
A cybertech themed world where the majority of civilization has withdrawn to the virtual world.
Most have died because of starvation.
No one knows which is real and which is the virtual.
One mechanic instead of Dodge could be switching between worlds rapidly to avoid attack.
Boss idea: massive bundle of TV screens, wires.

-Idea 2 
Historical themed world based on Incan culture.
They revered the dead and followed their orders into death.
Mummies.
Perhaps you play as a 'cursed' guard, or the thousands of incarnations of a sworn guard who has to perform a task.
Could have the area already depopulated via plague.
Work in traditional magic.
No conquistadors. They're boring.
Look to Incan tradition and mythology for non human bosses
Boss idea: mummified person atop a litter of corpses which still move them around.
