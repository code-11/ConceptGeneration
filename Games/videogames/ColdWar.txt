Ideas for Cold War game:

Sphere of influence
	Describes where/how much special actions in other countries can be taken
	Is scaled by *Prestige*. Obviously, US and Russia start with a fair bit of prestige.
	Historical centers of influence like french in indo china
	Can use influece points to spread to other countries, but have to commit? Large influence points to unlock intervention in additional countries, Small influence to spend within those countries. 

	Actions with influence
		Send war material to help certain sides of a war


Historical conflicts

UN 
	Can do diplomacy to try to get other countries to side with you on key votes

Coups and civil war
	Conflict starts as guerrilla or coup attempt, and can evolve into civil war

	Model out specific locations within the country? Model out the different ethnic makeup of those countries? Sounds hard.
