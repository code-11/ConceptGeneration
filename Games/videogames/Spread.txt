-You play as an evil/ good entity with the goal of spreading you influence across the land.
-geography effects your powers but you can also influence geography. Think mordor and mare of dead men from nw2
-game play is probably top down or iso 2d movement of units on a biard, trying to defeat heros with other hero's but you only have indirect control like in majesty.
-think of it like a simulation that you can heavily influence.
-could even be level based, or event based, with a main area but levels adding additional areas and m3chanics.
