Play as a group of people in a modern world.
Its kind of like inception where you are constantly pursued by people.
The waves of people are endless, its what you do and how long you last that makes it fun.
Also, the 3d environments are procedurally generated.
There is a large emphasis on getting in vehicles, at which point the enemies will also pursue you.
Kind of like just cause? 
Acquiring vehicles is much harder.
There might be civilians?
