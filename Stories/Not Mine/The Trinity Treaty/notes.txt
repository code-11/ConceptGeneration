-pg1 Little hard to keep track of all these characters and sides, but I'm sure it will become more clear as things go on.
-pg5 Introduction of energy drain could use a little smoothing. How would person know they could use it at will, enough to challenge a bear with it. What if it were just an effect from the tree. Probably better to have it be an accident, at least at first?
On a scale of 0->10 how close is this to being a self insert?
-pg6 So this is the love interest?
-pg11 This setting has modern elements and magic...
-pg14 So she's a vampire?
-pg15 Oh he plays piano and has a tragic backstory? Misunderstood/tortured artist?
-pg15 Do people normally give off light? Story didn't establish if everyone can see auras. Or was it referring to the lamp posts? If it was, why was that weird? Lampposts go off all the time.
-pg18 Ah, so Mist is an elf? Fordian = Elf, got it.
-pg22 There's an interesting amount of focus here on this sweatshirt. Is this a checkovs gun? (later answer, no, just romantic)


---------pg 25

-pg29 "After the potentially disastrous Council meeting turned out fine, Mist realized that even though she was flooded with relief, anger was still pounding through her./" doesnt flow
-pg 31 last paragraph doesn't flow
-pg 34 I like the names of the fordians
-pg 44 just realized now, why were mist and hawk the ones making the negotiations rather than someone older? They said themselves that Mist is very young by their standards. 
-pg 47 Now they're just doing stuff and meeting people and I'm not sure why?
-pg 49 Going to grandmother house even though the whole idea was to stay in hiding/protection?
-pg 52 “Keith,” I asked softly. “Why are you afraid of wolves?”  What? Was this established? Also, I think its perfectly reasonable to be afraid of wolves? 
-pg 54 are Enforcers and Protectors the same people?
-pg 55 Arctic totally bailed on them!
-pg 56 What was Nera before she was turned? A life stealer of a different sort? Or maybe a human? If a human, why did they turn her instead of eating her?

--------- pg 57

-pg 61 The geometry of them, Mist and the life stealer is very jumbled in my mind. 

--------- pg 66

-pg 66 Rhino? haha
-No page in particular: Why not just leave the area, if the life stealers are going after them here?
-pg 70 I completely forgot that it was Vine who was the female at the life stealer place
-pg 75 Did Darvis hit her? 
-pg 77 Vine very evasive. Not quite sure of the dialog here.
-pg 79 Besides Mist, Hawk, and now vine, I'm having a very hard time remembering all these fordians!

--------- pg 82
-pg 82 Having the names imply relations of the fordians is helpful vine->ivy
-pg 85 gnbou ??? ah its an acronym...hmmm kinda silly, but lampshaded, so I guess its ok.
-pg 87 what it must be like to live in a society that views you as less just because you don’t have a special talent. Is that what this story is about?
-89 Theres a lot of laughing here.
-91 "She didn’t seem like she was factually inaccurate at all." Too many negatives, not sure what they're trying to say here. 
-pg 93 changing narrative targets in a first person story is a bit odd. 
-pg 94 don't remember this girl with blue eyes. 
-pg 96 don't remember changed sight or keeping it a secret.
-pg 98 ok, now we're getting somewhere.
-pg 99 Woah, switch to third person! Is Mist sometimes narrating now?
-pg 110 Cedar and branch? There are too many characters here. 

--------- pg 116
-pg 120 ok now we're getting somewhere pt2
-pg 121 diacalthozine??
-pg 135 wow Melain really went for it. Blatantly and even in hostile territory? Seems not smart. They should pick a better leader. Or maybe there's some sort of racial law thing at play here, like a french king having some sway over a french person living in germany, since Nera is also a life stealer. 

--------- pg 142
-pg 143 something feels off about Melain's visit. What was he actually doing there? Why didn't he have some sort of escort when in Fordian territory? He is a foreign dignitary but he just gets to walk around? 
-pg 143 Not related to this section particularly, but I just realized one of the things about this is that young adult novels are usually a combination of action and romance/intrigue. Like harry potter has spells and stuff, and maze runner has its games. The problem here is that until now, with the brief exception of the life stealer interaction, there is no action. 
-pg 143 Second gripe. Many of the characters are not grounded. Keith is a nomad and Nera has her entire history obliterated. While thats good for getting things started and established, its bad for interactions past there. These characters, as far as I can tell, with the exception of finding Nera's grandmother, have no external goals, nor reasons tying them to this location. If they are threatened here by the life stealers, why do they not just move? Maybe Nera, despite her memory loss has some affinity to the area.
-pg 146 Girl with blue eyes reference
-pg 151 While Keith's mom interacting with him, leaving voicemails is realistic, its kind of an immersion killer. On one hand you have this interesting fantasy world filled with the types of people at conflict with one another and on the other end you have these very normal, almost assumedly normal modern relationships. We have mentioned his parents before. I think even maybe seen them when Nera stayed there? So it not quite out of left field, but I'm not sure what it accomplishes from a story point of view.
-pg 152 No, please, not more characters. I beg of you. Again, while it is realistic to introduce their families and what not, if you're not going to use the characters, or if they're not going to fill some story purpose, its best to streamline things. It is helped that families share name types, that makes it easier to remember who is who.
- pg 155 This is good, and establishes why the grandmother character is important, while providing more reason why Nera would want to stay in the area. This should be earlier.
-pg 159 Haha just kiss already!
-pg 160 I'm giving this one a buy since you introduced her earlier. But seriously reconsider adding new characters 2/3 of the way through the book. The other problem here is that its so stochastic. Nera took no actions to communicate with this person or find them. Then they show up. Events are happing but there is no action preceding them. There is no cause and effect, just external injection. Maybe Catherine has some part to play in all of this, and she was the one taking action, but I guess we will see.
- pg 164 Forbidden? Maybe this has been mentioned before... I don't remember
-pg 164 Why would it have been assumed that the life stealer would have changed Nera, instead of, lets say kidnapping her. How did they know the changing took place? Is there some external sign? May have been reference to this in the beginning of the book. I might check. 
- (Self note. Question of self insert. What is the purpose of this story, you've analyzed this as a story but maybe its a journal)
-pg 170s this got real fast.
-pg 187 Presumably Nera is wearing her gloves, such that the whole life steal things isn't a problem.
-pg 189 HPU/Protectors/ Enforcers are all the human faction? Too many synonyms, stick with protectors since its part of the acronym. I don't know that enforcers makes much sense. We haven't seen them enforce anything. Although, to be fair, we haven't seen them protect anything either. 
-pg 197, why is she falling unconscious? I seem to recall this isn't the first time this has happened... 
-pg 202 I too like that one scene from lord of the rings.
-pg 207, yay! being honest about one's feelings! 
-pg 208  Pr-Enforcers? See pg189 note.
-pg 208 oh shit, Vine is dead??
-pg 210 jesus this is fast
-pg 220 big oof for cedar. Also yeah, why did the protectors attack? Retaliation for the earlier Fordian attack? They shouldn't have taken Nera anyways. 
-pg 223, protector attack explained. oh now the council cares? Melian was all running around and they didn't bat an eye.
-pg 226 good reveal
-pg end, good ending.
