-pg1 Little hard to keep track of all these characters and sides, but I'm sure it will become more clear as things go on.
-pg3 ooooh, color! Ever read house of leaves? If not, remind me to send you my copy.
-pg5 Introduction of energy drain could use a little smoothing. How would person know they could use it at will, enough to challenge a bear with it. What if it were just an effect from the tree. Probably better to have it be an accident, at least at first?
On a scale of 0->10 how close is this to being a self insert?
-pg6 So this is the love interest?
-pg11 This setting has modern elements and magic...
-pg14 So she's a vampire?
-pg15 Oh he plays piano and has a tragic backstory? Misunderstood/tortured artist?
-pg15 Do people normally give off light? Story didn't establish if everyone can see auras. Or was it refering to the lamp posts? If it was, why was that weird? Lampposts go off all the time.
-pg18 Ah, so Mist is an elf? Fordian = Elf, got it.
-pg22 There's an interesting amount of focus here on this sweatshirt. Is this a checkovs gun?


---------pg 25

-pg29 "After the potentially disastrous Council meeting turned out fine, Mist realized that even though she was flooded with relief, anger was still pounding through her./" doesnt flow
-pg 31 last paragraph doesn't flow
-pg 34 I like the names of the fordians
-pg35 first paragraph doesnt flow
-pg 44 just realized now, why were mist and hawk the ones making the negotiations rather than someone older? They said themselves that Mist is very young by their standards. 
-pg 47 Now they're just doing stuff and meeting people and I'm not sure why?
-pg 49 Going to grandmother house even though the whole idea was to stay in hiding/protection?
-pg 52 “Keith,” I asked softly. “Why are you afraid of wolves?”  What? Was this established? 
-pg 52 Did this happen to you??
-pg 54 are Enforcers and Protectors the same people?
-pg 55 Arctic totally bailed on them!
-pg 56 What was Nera before she was turned? A life stealer of a differrnt sort? Or maybe a human? If a human, why did they turn her instead of eating her?

--------- pg 57

-pg 61 The geometry of them, Mist and the life stealer is very jumbled in my mind. 

--------- pg 66

-pg 66 Rhino? haha
-No page in particular: Why not just leave the area, if the life stealers are going after them here?
-pg 70 I completely forgot that it was Vine who was the female at the life stealer place
-pg 75 Did Darvis hit her? 
-pg 77 Vine very evasive. Not quite sure of the dialog here.
-pg 79 Besides Mist, Hawk, and now vine, I'm having a very hard time remembering all these fordians!

--------- pg 82
-pg 82 Having the names imply relations of the fordians is helpful vine->ivy
-pg 85 gnbou ??? ah its an acronym
-pg 87 what it must be like to live in a society that views you as less just because you don’t have a special talent. Is that what this story is about?
-89 Theres a lot of laughing here.
-91 "She didn’t seem like she was factually inaccurate at all." Too many negatives, not sure what they're trying to say here. 
-pg 93 changing narrative targets in a first person story is a bit odd. 
-pg 94 don't remember this girl with blue eyes. 
-pg 96 don't remember changed sight or keeping it a secret.
-pg 98 ok, now we're getting somewhere.
-pg 99 Woah, switch to third person! Is Mist sometimes narrating now?
-pg 110 Cedar and branch? There are too many characters here. 

--------- pg 116
-pg 120 ok now we're getting somewhere pt2
-pg 121 diacalthozine??
-pg 135 wow Melain really went for it. Even in hostile territory? Seems not smart. They should pick a better leader. 

--------- pg 142
