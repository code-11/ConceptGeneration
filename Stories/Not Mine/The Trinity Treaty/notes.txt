-pg1 Little hard to keep track of all these characters and sides, but I'm sure it will become more clear as things go on.
-pg3 ooooh, color! Ever read house of leaves? If not, remind me to send you my copy.
-pg5 Introduction of energy drain could use a little smoothing. How would person know they could use it at will, enough to challenge a bear with it. What if it were just an effect from the tree. Probably better to have it be an accident, at least at first?
On a scale of 0->10 how close is this to being a self insert?
-pg6 So this is the love interest?
-pg11 This setting has modern elements and magic...
-pg14 So she's a vampire?
-pg15 Oh he plays piano and has a tragic backstory? Misunderstood/tortured artist?
-pg15 Do people normally give off light? Story didn't establish if everyone can see auras. Or was it refering to the lamp posts? If it was, why was that weird? Lampposts go off all the time.
-pg18 Ah, so Mist is an elf? Fordian = Elf, got it.
-pg22 There's an interesting amount of focus here on this sweatshirt. Is this a checkovs gun?
