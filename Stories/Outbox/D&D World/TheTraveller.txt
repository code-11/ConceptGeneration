There is a character in the world called the Traveller.
He is a possibly a original member of the station that made the world engine/planet
However, the time and the madness of the world engine have sapped away at his memory 
He wanders the earth, immortal and unkillable, trying to find something
He doesn't know what he has to find, only that he will recognize it when he sees it.
The thing he needs to find is the runic statues in the desert, which will remind him of the legacy
Possibly also the empty pillar in the north pole

Haverson may meet him.
He may be pursued by the big evil's shadows/agents since he theoretically know all about the world engine.
