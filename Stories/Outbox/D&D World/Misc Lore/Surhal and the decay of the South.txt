Surhal and the decay of the southern gem

After the defeat of the elves, the human kingdom, with the Despot at its head, set up many cities reaching south.
Arhal and Surhal were created to be centerpeices of this kingdom, with the waste and war of the north to be forgotten. 
Arhal was controlled by the despot and Surhal was given to his greatest general.

When the human colonists arrived at Surhal, they found an abandoned temple up river overgrown by wilderness.

Secret: This temple is the southern branch of elves, who broke with Ishira/Aumnum-Ra and dedicated themselves to the wilderness. Went feral and were diminished.

They were fearful off the temple but founded the city at the mouth of the river regardless.

It grew in size and splendor as the despot aligned with opulence. The old site was considered ill suited for a palace and a place closer to quarryable rocks was chosen, Nebezwar, ontop of the previous elven ruin. After the defeat in the civil war, its majesty was greatly diminished and it fell into the water.

From this death gathered a number of people who saw acceptance in this diminishment, among these, the son of the previous general.  
This son became Geremon and his followers became the first adherents of the new god.

Seeing that the great many dead had to be taken care of, Geremon created the binding of Geremon to prevent the souls of the dead from being released back into the world as undead. They created two massive moseleums, onoe at Surhal and the other at Dor's Crag to house the bodies.
