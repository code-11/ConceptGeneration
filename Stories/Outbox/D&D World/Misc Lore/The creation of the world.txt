Somewhere between one and two thousand years  ago (so not actually that long) an advanced civilization realized a collision between their galaxy and another was going to happen. Normally such an event wouldn't effect many things, but they predicted that their entire solar system would collide with another larger red giant. In order to preserve their civilization against the oncoming fall, some of their brightest minds combined and came up with the plans for a incredibly powerful device capable of warping reality itself at a subatomic level. Combined with this device was an incredibly powerful AI capable of transferring arbitrary requests and wishes into reality.

This device and the scientist who had made it intended to use the device to set up a new world and reform their fractured civilization. They had prepared for this eventuallity and had planned to use an experiemental jump drive to transport them to a habitable planet they had found. However, their calculations were interrupted as the galaxies collided, and by concidense, during their jump, the collision shot them off course and into the gravity well of another planet. 

The planet (Svotera? Enya? Eynia?) turned out to be close to uninhabitable. It was a caustic hellhole of active volcanoes and deadly gas. The surface was rife with lava and blasted raw rock. 

They therefore decided to try to use the world engine to terraform this planet into one that they could live on, even though doing such a complicated maneuver was something none of them had tried. 

The operation was mostly a success. However, what they didn't know was that the planet that they had assumed was uninhabited was in fact the home of a interesting silicoln based bacteria species, which lived off the chemical vents of the planet.

Fascinated with their success, the vast majority of the scientists went down to the terraformed planet. However, a select cadre were selected to remain on the station to keep everything up to shape and to help the colonists, especially through the use of the engine.

However, these chosen few disagreed on a course of action and over time, came to resent the ones who got to go to the surface, and desired power for themselves. One of them planned on immersing himself in the world engine and at some level, integrating his intellegence in with the AI running it. 

The others, horrified and perhaps also jealous, joined. What they didn't realize was that such a melding was completely unstable. Their minds were ripped form their bodies and lost in the vastness of the capabilities of the AI and the world engine. 

The Transformation
However, with it under their control, they transformed the planet into their version of what *they* wanted, to make themselves gods. Before the colonists on the planet realized what they had done, it was too late, and most of them were killed.

This transformation was much more pervasive than even the instigators realized, and not even they were untouched by its affects. Technically, it involved reprogramming part of the AI's internal code towards wanting to basically make a fantasy world. The tome, the people who would become gods, the colonists, even the land itself and the space around the planet would be affected by this transformation.

One of the main things the transformation did was to make a sun sphere for the world. This sun is not actually all that large and revolves around the planet rather than vice versa. The transformation also made several moons. 

One of the few who remained on the station did not meld with the world engine. She would become the Lady of Secrets, influencing things subtly from her place on the station while trying to keep her companions alive. One of her most important acts was to send the instruction manual for the world engine to the planet. 

Tome of Infinite Knowledge-
The tome is a instruction manual for the world engine. No one remembers its original form for not even it survived the transformation unchanged. It now resembles a massive book. Its actual shape, form, size, all vary. However it always has the following properties:
-It is invincible. It is immune to all mundane physical damage. Dirt and other things that would normally ruin books simply slides right off it. Incredible physical or magical damage can cause it to temporarily rupture, but it will reform eventually.
-It has the ability to be understood by any intellegence but only after long periods of study. "Reading" the book in this manner is incredibly hard and of a considerable mental effort. Most who encounter the book simply see a jumble of symbols which fit no language they have ever seen. It typically takes a year of study to read a full page. Once a person reads the book they understand some about the function of the world engine, but in a intuitive rather than studied way. Therefore the book may been read without the reader knowing what it truely is. 
-The book is not really a book. Being under the effect of the world engine, the tome has to take real physical form. However, it is of the engine itself and represents its core functions.
-The book has an infinite number of pages. However, a person who has read a page from the book may split the book into smaller sections. Because this can be done an infinite amount of times, a sizable number ~20 sections of the book have been made, usually being books of renown in and of themselves.
-The book doesn't always look like itself. If a page or pages are lifted form the original, they can take the form of another book, or be combined with any mundane book, enhancing it to magical status, with most of the properties described above.

Uzerai-The transformation affected the planet in many ways. It was a former volcanic hellscape, at least for its colonizers. However, what the colonists did not know, is that it in fact was habited. On its surface, living off the chemical plumes of the less hostile sulfur zones was a collection of silicoln based single celled organisms. These organisms formed large matte like colonies and spires that were unfortunately very simmilarly looking to the plume funnels they congregated around.They had actually undergone a bit of evolution and the colony could react to external threats using a sluggish but effective system of chemical signals.

When the transformation happened, the world engine struggled to incorporate such an alien collection of organisms into the world it was attempting to build. The end result was Uzerai. The Uzerai are humanoid elementals which typically dwell in places of extreme heat. In keeping with their chemical signalling mechanism, they together form a planet spanning physic gestalt intellegence. This intellegence, also called Uzerai, is recently conscious and self aware, but in a constant state of horror and incomprehension at the world which, to its eyes, has been transformed into a hostile hellscape. Consciousness to it is a nauseating and neverending hell from which it desperately wishes to be delivered but lacks the understanding to free itself.

Uzerai together is essentially an alien god and affects on the world commensurate with that power, but operates very slowly. It neither understands nor cares for the lives of the people on the surface and wishes the world to return to its prior condition and for it to return to its unconscious state.
