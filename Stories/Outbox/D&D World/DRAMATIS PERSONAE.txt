Shani Saltfolk- 
The Shani all have a love of the ocean, whether they are traders, fisherman, or pirates. They do not stray far from the ocean and prefer salt water over fresh water. Although they are aspected to the Wave King, most are dismissive of religion. 
Dex +2
Cha +2
Lithe: Gain the effects of the defensive duelist feat (when have finesse weapon and hit, can use reaction to raise AC by proficiency bonus)
Born to the water: Advantage handling ships, fishing, reading the weather and all perception checks on the water. Movement in water is 3/4 movement rather than 1/2
The wavelord's call: Once per long rest you gain a vague idea of the nearest source of water within x miles, this ability prioritizes salt over fresh water. You can drink salt water.
Made for Trade: The Shani engage all nations in trade, making linguistic abilities a must. You know one additional language.

Shani Acolyte
Revered and slightly feared among shani, the Acolytes are the fanatical worshippers of the wave king. One immediate noticeable feature is their pale white skin and frail constitutions. Although most devote their time to occult rituals and carrying out the machinations of the wave king, a select few are chosen to be guards or even assassins. An acolyte is bound to turn many heads, even in non-Shani lands. 
Dex+2
Wis+1
Int+1
Con-1
Born from the waves: 
-You can cast the spell create water, either salt or fresh, once per long rest.
-You can breath under water.
The wave king's command: Your voice flows from His mouth, and all who hear it pay heed. You have advantage on all persuasion checks made against Shani. At 3rd level you gain the spell Suggestion which can be cast once per long rest.
The spell casting stat for this spell is wisdom.
-You can understand, speak and write temple script, a language usually only known by other Acolytes.
