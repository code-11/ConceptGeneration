Its been five years since Aruk Gavraldis left his family and set off seeking fortune in war.

Things have really only gone down since then. Despite initially successful employment, the war/skirmish he was employed in dragged on and eventually swung to the other side's favor.

With money running low, the side employing Aruk forcibly kept him in their employ. During a particularly disastrous battle, Aruk's left leg was maimed. 

Finally having enough, he snuck off before either side could stop him.

Having been in the Wulurn Confederacy now for three years, he has made his living doing odd errands, both legal and illegal, hopefully trying to find enough money to heal his leg. Although he has met many people in the town he has stayed in, he finds that he can't quite connect to any one, except for the priests of the local temple to Liwanu.

Sometimes he wonders whether he should just have stayed a farmer like his brother. 

He remembers the armor of the man who wounded him and fantasizes about seeking revenge. 

Usually a calm and surprisingly subdued minotaur for his size, he is prone to fits of rage, especially when drunk.

He awaits the spark of adventure to drag his spirit back up to the heights of his (relative) youth.
