Acolyte, I must admit I am conflicted.

The main source of this conflict comes from the genesis of my faith.
I fought for a long time for the tribes of Wulurn against the Itochel. But it must be said that most of my motivation was greed for money and pride and general warlust. 

While there, I was tempered somewhat by the horrors of the encounters and eventually defeated in battle.
For a time I was purposeless. 

Then I came across a man whom you might know, acolyte Ivv√°r Heigen. When I told him of my story, rather than pity, he admonished me. He told me that my defeat was due to my lack of finesse. I had an axe but swung it wildly. I had strength but lacked purpose and cunning. 
He explained that Liwanu's teachings would save me. And I agreed to learn the creed.

However, as of late I have found myself slipping back more and more into rushing into situations, perhaps due to my kind's intrinsic nature... How can I deal with the bloodlust and approach things from a rational and tactical manner (praised be Liwanu and the preparation of strategem)?

More specifically are there any acts I can perform to consecrate my following of Liwanu?

Finally, just out of curiosity, what are Liwanu's teachings regarding undead?
