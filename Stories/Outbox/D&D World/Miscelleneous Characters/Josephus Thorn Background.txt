Josephus Thorn is a local guide and woodsman. Following the death of his parents he decided the urban life was horrible and retreated to the swamp.

He makes a living as a guide, doing odd tasks and hunting. During one of his hunts into the swamp he encountered a wolf pup which he raised. This hunting wolf, Charlie follows him everywhere. In the isolation of his tiny cabin several miles from the nearest town, some wonder if Josephus hasn't gone a bit stir crazy, and some recall him talking to his pet.

He carries his father's old war spear which is called Arfast. It was the only thing of value Josephus got for his inheritance. His mother died of sickness three years ago and his father died almost ten years ago in a meaningless border skirmish between two human city states.

Josephus is a consummate woodsman, with a skill for tracking and hunting. An everyman, he is surprisingly literate for a man who lives in the middle of the woods, but rarely talks at length except to Charlie. 

He finds the politics and rumormongering of the nearby town annoying and tedious. People know his name but he is not necessarily a friend.

He admires woodcarving, taxidermy, soldiering, hunting and general self sufficientness. He secretly looks down in destain upon the people he guides.
