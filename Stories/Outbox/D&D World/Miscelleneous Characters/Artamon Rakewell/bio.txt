Artamon Rakewell was once the third son of a minor noble house. His two brothers impressed their father with their feat at arms, but Artamon was often sick and lacked constitution. Secretly disgusted by his physical ineptitude, his family sent him to become a scribe at a far off keep.

Humiliated by this rejection, Artamon vowed regain his family's trust in whatever way he could. So, when the master scribe offered to teach him the basics of magic, he leapt at the opportunity.

Along the way Artamon developed a twisted world world view: only the strong are worth anything. A person's true goal in life is to claw and scratch your way towards more power by any means possible. Bit by bit, the accumulation of power became Artamon's driving obsession, and his family was eventually, but perhaps not entirely, forgotten.

Eventually, Artamon learned that the master scribe's choice of remote physical location was not an accident. In the dark hours of the night, the scribe practiced strange arts and called upon strange dark gods. Artamon often watched secretly from a hole in ceiling.

One night in particular, artamon awoke to find an odd black sword beside his bed. Once he took a hold of it, his path became clear. He attacked his former master in the midst of a ritual and, once killing him, sacrificed him to the Raven Queen, creating his warlock binding. After all, if the scribe were stronger, he would have stopped him.

He still caries the strange shadowy blade from that day, and along with a blackened shiled taken from the corpse of a less prepared duelist, he now creeps around the outer reaches, looking for people to kill, and more opportunities to prove himself and his devotion to his dark mistress.

Strength through will; strength in all things; only the strong survive.
