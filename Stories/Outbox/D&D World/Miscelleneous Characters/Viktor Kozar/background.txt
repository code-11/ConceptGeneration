Hello my friend, I am Vicktor Kozar...

Ah, you have heard of my name? Oh, no, you have not? It is of no matter. I am of very interested in your wares, especially that crystal there...

Oh my, 200 gold? My friend, that surely cannot the price be! Let me explain my friend, you see I need that piece of crystal to finish my collection, the fragments of a shattered whole!

The other pieces? Yes, well verily this will be the first one.

Hey, now hold on, my friend, let me look at it for a moment at least.

Haha, now poof it is gone! 
Ack! Friend, friend. A joke it is! A joke! There is the crystal there on your shelf. I shall not bother you my friend, I will be going!

(A moment later the illusion vanishes. The shopkeep curses Kozar)

Viktor Kozar is a strange fellow. His upbringing is not known, even to himself. Of mixed lineage, he was raised by studious wizard monks in isolation. However, at some point in his training, he came into contact with a great an unknowable being. 

Upon contact, Kozar went completely mad, raving about strange dark milky crystals and shapes and smells no one else could see.

Seemingly driven towards a great effort known only to him, he seeks out strange and often useless trinkets for his own inscrutable purpose. He steals, uses social manipulation and curses those in his path, but refuses to inflict direct harm upon another creature.

Surprisingly affable and social for a madman, it takes a bit of time to realize that he is stark raving mad, and it is this friendliness that has gained him one time access to many odd and restricted places. 

He is six feet and always sports a slightly too long black beard, often accompanied by stringy long black hair hid amid a hood.

Is he truly mad or simply following a purpose too vast, important and inscrutable for the sane to comprehend? Perhaps not even Viktor knows!
