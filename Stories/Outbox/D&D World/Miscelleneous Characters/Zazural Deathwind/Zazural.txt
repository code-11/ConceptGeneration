Aarakocra are usually good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Only half of this trueism holds for Zazural. 

The black Aarakocra of the crags are fanatics of the mistress of shadow, Lilith. They worship her darkness, and vow to do her bidding. 

They live in a desolate communal state, many dying of malnutrition, the crags having very little in the way of food (and the surrounding, being under the aegis of various nations, look at the blacklings with horror)

Zazural is a zealot's zealot. When it was time for Zazural's coming of age ritual, he instead convinced his sibling, Proxis to follow him into the dark recesses of a cave he had found. Claiming to hear the true voice of Lilith, he murdered his brother in her name.

He is said to have emerged from the cave wielding a strange silver shortsword with his brother's name etched on the side and dark powers, which he claimed were given to him by the dark mistress herself. 

He has had no home since he has left on his journey of subterfuge. He wanders the land, often sleeping in caves and other remote places, relying on visions Lilith sends him to know who or what his next target is. He works for neither money nor reputation and is disliked by even other theives. 

Despite all his short comings, he has an eye for fine art, especially sculpture and likes all kinds of animals, even if his dark curse causes them to run in fear from him.
