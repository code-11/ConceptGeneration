D&d World

Haverson is young and traveling between Dor's Crag and Mellont
The roads are not safe because of the fighting going on in Lord Gerrant's War
Meets the pilgrim at night along the road by his campfire
Pilgrim is an ageless being who is actually a "god" 
Has no real power to speak of and runs from fights.
Looking for something, but he doesn't know what. Will only know it when he finds it.

Necromancer knows about the pilgrim and would like to get rid of him.
Constantly sends Shadows against him so the pilgrim always has to run.
People think that the pilgrim is making the shadows.
Two encounters, looters and shadows. 
Can come up with key locations.

Want to explore both's characters
Has Haverson been in the military yet or not?

One day the pilgrim will find what he is looking for. But perhaps he will not actually want what he finds, (godhood?)
