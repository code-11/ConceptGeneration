- Starts in wildermark
- Wildermark is a new town created by the Guild of Progressive Development
- They have had trouble getting people to emigrate into the wilderness, especially since it goes deep into the old elven.
- Wildermark has perhaps 100-200 people in total.
- it takes a full week to get to the nearest city by foot and longer when the weather is bad.
- In wildermark, keeping the peace and providing protection is Tiebald's Band, a mercenary ground (about 40 men)
- The band is lead by Tiebald, an old sargent from the war who lead the troops for one of the non-aligned factions
- In the past, living has been hard but recently there have been dissapearances and the townfolk are scared.
- Combined with this, the crops have failed and the farmers are not sure why. 
- Possible other people of interest:
	Sile-The 2nd in command of the Band, 
	Valenes Ypsilanti -A priest of Geremon
	Everard Lomerge -The mayor
	Serle de Margas-A representative/agent of the Guild of Progressive Development
	Herleva Cardis -An observer of the civil guard.

-Wildermark is in an interesting legal position, it is owned by the Guild and is not a formal part of the North
	-The guard disavows all protection and in fact indirectly draws possible settlers away from it because of war requirements.
-In actuality the forest is active with the weed network of a disgruntled ancient elf.
-This elf has learned the secrets of the wildnerness (gone completely crazy) by meeting the wild godling. 
-Has constructed an abomination plant creation which has grown out of his control.
-He operates from the nearby fort.
