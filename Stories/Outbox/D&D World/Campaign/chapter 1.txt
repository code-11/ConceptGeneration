chapter 1

Faye: A forest spirit attacks sirle de margas in his bed. If Faye is there, he lets her protect him. Her ring.
Maya has a horrifying vision of the sun and a spec of void.
The next day Leon is approached by his fellow acolyte who wants to use some of the herbs Agnez collected to perform a rain ritual.

They presumably journey into the woods to find the source of the vines, which is the fortress Kom-el-Amar
