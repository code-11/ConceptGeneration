Iris - The Sovereign, The Elf, The Moon
Coin - Darkness, The Mask, The Golden Chalice  
Loras - One card alone, the Boy, two cards together, two Deaths

- Contest of champions in Arhal
	-Germain Lemarr will be presiding, summons kerrack avatar with Israel harper

	It gets set up outside the town since its too destructive
	Contestants cannot fight one another outside the gaze of Kerrack until the contest is over

		Ray Of Frost
			Make a ranged spell Attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
		Counterspell
		
		Erupting earth
			Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

		Guiding bolt
			Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
