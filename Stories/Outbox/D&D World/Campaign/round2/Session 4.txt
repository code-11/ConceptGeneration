Loras deals with the outcome of the eclipse.
The others feel it a bit as well -> a shiver. Especially Iris. Costas feels caffinated.

Seymour Drogace follows them. 

The connection between Arhal and Surhal has become perilous 
There is a increase in wild animals in the area (secretly caused by a totem of wilderness planted by the wilderness-elves)
Several merchants have been found dead, so they requested armed guard. 
This detered several attacks, but recently the squad assigned and the latest merchant caravan has gone missing. 

Edward Wiggins - Useless count of Emmet's Station. Very hesitant. Son of the much more respected Arthur Wiggins, who died in the seige of Illithar.



The most recent caravan has been totally killed, their bodies pecked to death. They see the bodies twitch a bit. 

Aaron wright - Squire that went with the caravan guard. Has gone slightly to ground since the attack.
