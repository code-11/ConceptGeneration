Still following after the grandmaster of Geremon: Emlyn Bower
Nathaniel Garwood - Archeologist

Loras deals with the outcome of the eclipse.
The others feel it a bit as well -> a shiver. Especially Iris. Costas feels caffinated.

Seymour Drogace follows them. 

The connection between Arhal and Surhal has become perilous 
There is a increase in wild animals in the area (secretly caused by a totem of wilderness planted by the wilderness-elves)
Several merchants have been found dead, so they requested armed guard. 
This detered several attacks, but recently the squad assigned and the latest merchant caravan has gone missing. 

Edward Wiggins - Useless count of Emmet's Station. Very hesitant. Son of the much more respected Arthur Wiggins, who died in the seige of Illithar.



The most recent caravan has been totally killed, their bodies pecked to death. They see the bodies twitch a bit. 

Iris uses magical sense to find totem power. They B-line it to the heron nest, beat their faces in, depower the totem and make it back. They take the baby heron.

Surhal is in a depression. No ships in a long time (caused by the Shani being mad at the south)
Seymour Drogace is still following them.


Met at the entrance by Bordred Rum. Bordred Rum is a large man with a hollow expression. He believes the chapter of Geremon is at a close.
Rumors of river fisherman seeing strange man-like shapes further up river.  
People hear groans coming from the Town graveyard. Blame it on the new commers.

Bordred Rum can explain that the count/Duke that oversaw Surhal never lived there. Instead he lived upstream at Nebeswar (neb-Awad).
