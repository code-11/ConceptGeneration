Notes for Nebeswar

Background - 
Nebeswar stands somewhat decrepit amid vine and roots of the encroaching jungle and the flooding of the river.

By the looks of it, it used to be finished with fine ashlar, but age and weather have reduced its covering down to its dark and moss stained filler stone. 

The "palace' itself has stood up fairly well to the elements compared to the surround compound buildings. Besides the two columned rows buildings flanking the entrance the rest are in ruins. 

The row buildings are in a bad state. DC 10 to tell they're ready to fall. DC 15 To avoid 3d6 crushing damage. 

1st Floor -
The palace is accessible through stairway. At the entrance is the ruined throne room. Inlaid gold in the floor. Ruined purple carpet. 

Two of the rooms have been taken over by virulent red moss. DC 15 Nature check to know the type. Or DC 17 constitution save or be poisoned for 1d4 hours.

One corner of the temple has fallen away. DC 13 Dex save to avoid falling and taking 2d6 falling damage.

Thorns have taken over one of the rooms. DC 13 Dex save or be stuck for 3d4 damage. 

The Rug in the makeshift treasure room is simply draped over a hole in the floor. 2d6 falling damage. 

The chests contain a (cursed) golen circlet of plour, a solid gold challace with emrald and ruby inlaid, and a silver elven ankh.  

2nd Floor
This floor has been encrouched upon by roots and water from the nearby stream. 

The altar have been disrupted by the rivers flow. Messing with the altar will disrupt a nymph, two willowhisps and an ooze. The nymph has charmed the archiologist.

Behind the deep pool is a icon of ashira which can cast longstride four times and entangle once.    

3rd Floor
The Grandmaster is dead by a massive magical inscription. He seemed to be trying to add something to it. 

A dark black crystal is buried in his head. 

Two braziers are unlit and will give no surprise attack to shines if used. A number of wandering undead have congregated by the locked door and are trying to get out.

General Ailmar Argent is there and will talk to the characters. If they properly convince him that they'll take care of the problem, he will give them a magical longsword with the following properties:
For every 50gp fed into the sword it adds +1 as a magical bonus which lasts for one day from the feeding. It will also contain the spirit of the general.
