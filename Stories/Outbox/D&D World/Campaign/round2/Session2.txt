Havinstead has been paralyzed by bandits in the countryside. 
The council suspects both sides. 
Serge's interaction with them swayed the consideration against the south.
The council consists of three sides:
	-The North
		-Charles Gribard - Former veteran turned merchant. Popular with the fishermen, Shani, merchants, and craftsmen. Owns a "small" house in high hill but is often found in his office by the docks. 
	-The South
		-'Baroness' Victoria Lockton - A former noble, it is said she desires a return to the aristocracy of old. She is well spoken and popular with the rural landed elite as well as those of High Hill. Operates from her estate in Highhill but has holdings in the surrounding lands.
	-Independence
		-Sigfried Esseldorf- youngest of the council, he remembers clearly the humiliation of the South, and desires a truly independent and active Havinstead. He has the backing of most of the urban Havinsteaders. Operates from a large Inn in the center of town.
