The disciples of Kerack keep an updating list of who they think are the most powerful fighters in the realm in nonmagical combat. The ordering of this list is highly disputed, so here they are in no particular order:

Israel Harper - Master duelist and saber expert. Has been known to work for the duke but never stays in one place for long. Will only accept duels from those of similar skill. 

Meridia - A former adventurer and soldier from the north. Has lost to Israel several times, most recently at a tourney in westfield. Usually In Dor's Crag. Open to all duels.

The master of the Order of the Spine (a Shani monastic order) name and location unknown.

Supreme Commander Durand, leader of the north. Also, all of the commanders of the north. Most are former adventurers. Most can be found in Illithar. They do not accept duels, especially not from southerners. 

Germain Lemarr - The unofficial high priest of Kerack. He lives on the outskirts of Havinstead, and grudgingly accepts duels. 

Voidwalker - An unknown northern assassin. Infamous for the deaths of many battlemages in the dukes war. Has not been seen since then. (Mostly on the list because of his fame and because Kerack's disciples don't get along with the battlemages)
