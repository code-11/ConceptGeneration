The surer queen is a eldritch good demi god.
Physically she is a too tall humanoid with many spider like arms.
 The whole of her body is covered with blood stained gauze, stichings, burns.
Her too long legs bend the wrong way, like a birds, but some sign in how she walks tells you that they are broken rather than like that way naturally.

She helps and nutrires all beings that venture into her domain, and can heal anything.
However, her magic is tragic in nature and her healing must break as well as heal.
Actually, she heals, but does not heal.
A dead person could be resurrected, but would remain looking like a corpse and have all the signs of one
Burns can be healed but the skin doesn't etc.

Some attack her as an abomination, she merely flees deeper into her domain
Her domain is close to another otherworldly dimension which seeps into ours.
Although she would flee in combat, her followers might not and she will heal them each time.

For the woSt injuries, you get emblamed in wrapping and have to be stored in her inner sanctum immobilized for at least a week, next to others undergoing the same treatment.

If d&d world, possible scion of the goddess ashira, would operate out of the broken ruins of the world tree.
