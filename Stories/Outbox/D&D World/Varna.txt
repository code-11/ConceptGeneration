Look, I'm not saying its a bad place per se, but its just not for me. 

...

Yeah, thats right, I was here for almost a year... Hell its hard to believe that. This is a place that picks people up. It not like the north at all. You'll see just as many elves as men, and of course the Shani. 

...

No, of course they don't keep to themselves. Gods, you really have just arrived haven't you? Hrmm. Well, you're in for a bit of a culture shock. You said you're from the North? I see. Me too. 

...

How'd I get here? Same as you. There's only one way to this place, on one of those ocean boats. Now I grew up on the water; I went up and down the river even when I was young, but these Shani, they build these boats so that they never have to see land. Well, of course you know that, you're here aren't you?

...

Trading huh. Well, I hope you've got your wits about you. You and everyone's uncle is trading here, and no one will drive a harder bargin than the Shani. For sure. You walk into a shop wanting a thing for fifty copper, they'll have you leaving fifty silver lighter and thinking you're getting a deal!

...

Dishonest? That word doesn't describe the calibur of the operations that go on here. You need to completely rethink how you approach transactions...

...

An example? No I don't have an example, I wasn't here for trading, I was a miner...

...

Ah, you're from Dor's Crag? Great place. I'm not actually from there though, I'm from outside Mellont myself...

...

Well, there *are* mines there. Damn good ones too I'll let you know! But you got me off topic, I was telling you about the Shani. Don't let their size beguile you, they are a feisty bunch. They're not like us Northerners. You and I, we give our word, we keep our word. Hells, most of us will put it in writing without thinking. 

But here? A word is just a word. A cough more like! There are no judges, there is no military, no guard. They have no need. Things just happen.

...

Hahahaha break the law? I'm not sure you're understanding. There are no laws like that here! You steal something? Its yours. You mad someone stole something? Get some of your pals; steal it right back! Thats how it works here. Gods, don't you know, thats how the king is even decided, you just gotta steal that crown right off of his head!

...

Murder you say? Sure, there are murders. Its a city after all. If you murder, the guys friends will show up; if they find the guy and return the favor. 

...

Chaos? Yes, exactly, or... well sort of....

Well, its like this city. Have you gotten a look at it? There not one god damn plumb wall in the place, and they like it that way. Its a sea of brown mud brick. This place we're in is for people like us, who like a bit of wood. The Shani will work in it, and they're actually damn good carpenters, but here in Varna, its all about the mud. 

But like I said, its all about the city. Everything is at an angle. These building, they follow no pattern and veer off in every direction. Have you walked around yet? No? Hrm. Don't if you can't help it. A man could get lost taking a single turn in this place. It stinks and I swear the whole place is sinking into the water.

So thats what I was saying. Its chaos. Everything everywhere. The people, the buildings, the interactions, the business. Look, I know I just met you, but I'll give you some advice. This city isn't for people like you. You should leave and go to one of the smaller cities off the coast. They're used to northerners. 

...

Ok, thats fair. I did stay a year. But I'm regretting it. Thats why I'm leaving. I don't care what the company wants to pay me. I'm on the next boat out of here.

...

Nothing changed. The deal's still good. Yeah, I said a word is just a word, but if you know the person, you can get a sense of whether to trust them or not. Madness, I know.

Well, maybe something did change. I'm not sure I want to talk about it... Well now. Thats a bit of gold isn't it? Honestly I don't know whether that makes me feel better or worse. No don't look around like that, no one cares. I could stab you right now and no one would bat a fucking eye. Thats how this place works.

...

Relax. I'm sorry I said that thing about the stabbing, I meant to disrespect. Let me start at the beginning. I was hired to prospect, but when I arrived they just had me swinging my pickaxe at the soapstone quarry up to the north west. 

Now its honest work, but its not really what I crossed a sea to do right? I complain a bit after a while and they feign ignorance. SO I get into their business. This was before I had really figured out how this place worked. The owner, he's a good guy but he just dumped me into the deep end. I'm not sure to curse him or praise him.

So then they had me doing so more hush hush stuff. 

...

That is quite a bit of coin. You're going to attract attention of the wrong sort with that kind of money... Look, come with me, real quick, we can't really talk here. Also, don't look at the man in black. I think he caught a sight of that gold. Actually, better yet, give it to me right now, and be real obvious about it. You'll thank me later.

......

Ok, listen, there are less ears here so I will tell you what I know. And honestly its going to sound like a load of rubbish, but you paid me good, and I'll tell you what I know, or rather what I feel. 

...

No I can't talk to you about what I was doing. Not even if I wanted to. Gods no, don't try to give me more coin. Whats wrong with you? Just listen ok?

I said this place was chaos right? Before? Yeah, well it is. People stealing, the city, all of it. But recently I've been thinking that its just the top of things. You know how a wave hits a shore, the spray just goes everywhere? But hey, you don't know how deep that water is right? 

Well... This water is deep. I just kind of got the feeling. Whatever it is has got to do with the temple. 

...

Did you honestly just ask what temple? Gods, the plotweaver must be working for you himself, for me to have caught you before you went out into Varna without know anything like you do.

The temple. They're the white skinned ones. Even shorter than the regular Shani. You don't usually see them outside. They don't exactly run the place, this isn't like Illithar or the South. But if you're following me, the spray I was telling you about earlier, it was caused or at least connected to the deep part. 

The temple? They're the deep part. You have to understand. These Shani, they like their chaos, they cut throats, they raid one another, they steal and the weasel out coin, but at the end of the day, they're children of the waves. 

You ever been into Temple of the Wave? I don't necessarily recommend it, but when or if you do, take a look at the architecture. Not the small stuff, just the large central space. They'll always have a statue of the Wave King himself, but the important part is the space. 

I learned from a friend that the space I'm talking about, thats like us, or at least that how he described it. You're free to move around, pray, not pray, so on, they don't care. What important, or at least symbolically, is the space. No matter where you go in that building you're in that space.

Those temples are for the Shani, not us. We go in there, sure whatever. But the temples are for the Shani. Its a reminder. They can go anywhere, do anything, but at the end of the day, they're always in the Wave King's Dominion. Like I mean belong to him, tied with bonds you or I couldn't even understand.

You ever wonder why the Shani never show up in Dor's crag? They trade so much with that city, why don't they show up right?

...

Ok fine, so they show up briefly, but there's probably only ten or so permanent residents right? They can't be that far from the ocean for too long I think. Or... Or he calls them back somehow. 

Do you see now? You're surrounded by hands, His hands, all waving, drifting in the water like that water plant crap that makes this place smell so bad. But watch out, they're not human. They are not human. Suddenly the current changes and all of a sudden the hands are pointing at you, get what I'm saying? There's a body to those hands, an abyss to those chaotic waves. 

Ah. Well thats it. My crazy story. Was it worth all that gold? I hope so. You'll see soon enough if you're crazy enough to stay here as long as I have. Just stay clear of those temple people. They're the worst of it. They don't really care about you either unless He directs them. Just go on your way. You see something? You didn't see anything. Just go on your way. You didn't see anything...

Yeah, of course I'm fine. Thats a stupid question. Look, its been nice taking your gold, but I've got the feeling the guy in black back there isn't going to wait for much longer. 

...

What am I going to do? Don't worry about that. There's a back entrance over there, hopefully he's just working alone. Go now. Again, just don't put your nose where it doesn't belong. I go gotta deal with that shit.

You asking again? You're pretty sentimental for a trader huh. Well, fine, I'm going to put this sword through the bastard if he tries anything. And for good measure, once I've done that, I'm going to take *his* gold.

...

Hey, don't look at me like that. You'll see. Thats how this place works. Ha. You'll get used to it. Welcome to Varna.
