About the dungeon:
Following a medium sized earthquake, a Shepard seems to have found the entrance to the fabled Forges of Cerras and
Demetrion, a master wizard and cleric. These two almost single handedly destroyed the Elven kingdom with some sort of golemancy during the Human-Elvish war. The dungeon will probably have a fair amount of traps, environmental hazards, a puzzle or two and probably two or three fighting encounters. Theoretically no one has been here for almost a century, so everything should be easy, right?

Note on character creation:
Lets use 5e for this one. All Race/Class combinations are fine, but may not exist fluffwise. Just build the character and we can talk through the fluff stuff before the session at some point. If you really want to play with my fluff I've included a bit on the world, along with a map.

That big red arrow on the map is where you're going.
