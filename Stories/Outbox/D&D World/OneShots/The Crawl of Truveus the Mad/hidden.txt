You wake up as if from a dream with no memory of how you got here. You feel sore and tired, and you don't feel all there, your head hurts some.

-Truveus the mad went against the god of nature and lost
-Truveus himself was a masterful druid/wizard whose powers came from the seasons
-His familiar/nature companion/wife is an Hema Lamia with a third eye made in his own twisted creations
-He carried a walking stick gnarrled with leaves and thorns
-Because he had committed so many crimes against animal, plant and human kind, the god cursed him to a obliette under the ocean 
-Also fragmented his consciousness and made him face horrifying trials again and again, resetting if he died or succeeded.

Book1-Brown
The experiments are going well. It seems that this location is situated in the best natural lay lines. I've managed to splice together many kinds of animals and I'm convinced that human experimentation will go just as well. I've gotten a priest who comes by once and a while and rants at me about what he thinks I'm doing. So far, the aprentices have been enough to keep him away. The fool talks about my acts as unnatural. Life and death, death and life, can't he see that they are just two halves of the same whole?

Book2-Red
The experiments are going fantastic! I'm learning more than ever have in the past. <Sewing together parts of animals, opening them to see how they work, torturing them the understand their mental endurance> I seem to have inadvertently located my lab at a major node of some immense natural power. Human experimentation is a rockier venture, but several apprentices have thankfully volunteered their services. Unfortuntately none of the initial trials are stable. I can keep them alive, but none can live without my spells.  The priest has gotten more insistent and several of his followers have set up some camp nearby.

It must be related to the power node I have found. After inspecting it in detail I have come to the conclusion that it is connected tot he god of nature in some way, and I have begun determining how I can make use of its power. 

Book3-Green 
Those damn fanatics! The apprentices are dead, having stalled time for me to set up the defenses. The nature clerics are at my door in force, screaming about heresy. Every week they send a fully armed group of fifteen men or more.

I've locked the doors and sealed the lab, but I can feel the god itself leaning on me heavily. The spells are getting harder and harder to cast...

Hema, the last of the apprentices, and the most capable, has offered to undergo one last experiment. I pray it goes well.
I've had her magically hide my journals.

Book4-White
Everything is doomed. Everything is fine. 
I have breached the power node and turned it to my whim. There is nothing they can do to stop me now. Life and death, death and life are in my grasp. Although I cannot escape this place, I am functionally immortal. I will laugh as they turn again and again before me. They cannot break the cycle. The cycle cannot be broken.

Lamia

In front of you is a massive Lamia, the body of a woman and the tail of a snake. She looks up from the circle where she seems to have been waiting for you. As she grins, you can see some very large and certainly non-human teeth. Finally, she is unarmed, but wears a set of pitch black runic plate armor which appears to have been custom built for her.  

She stands within what appears to be a magic circle. 

"I have to say, I'm always hopeful when someone comes through that door. Will you do better than your predecessors? I'll make it quick, I am the only thing capable of opening the inner sanctum behind me, but because of the geas, I can't help you directly. You'll have to answer some questions and come to your own conclusions. Unfortunately I can't ask you anything directly, very frustrating. Imagine if I could just tell you that <unintelligible> Wouldn't that be great?"

Inside a many storied room, you can find history and future. To find that history though, you must first be second to none. 


-----FIRST-----
First question leads to a series of numbers that lets you look up a book:
"It seems like I am the only one left. No matter how we tried, we could not seem to truly kill him. Again and again we obliterated his body, and sealed his abomination, but every time he came back, and our numbers soon shrank. The last time we lost two of my fellow masters. I was furious beyond words. I couldn't break the cycle but I could <unintellegible>, I can't think of a more fitting nor ironic punishment seeing as it mirrors so well his own work. But at what a cost? The entrance has been sealed and I can't seem to open it. It seems our god disagrees with my methods, my magic no longer works. Perhaps our god hoped to just seal the problem away? Hopefully the person reading this fairs a better fate than mine." -Master of seals and glyphs, the eternal golden branches. 

In a small note slipped in the side, it reads, Don't trust her! If you can simply make it to the staff you can be free of this place!

-----SECOND----
I have hands but cannot clap. I have a voice but cannot speak. I have a face but no mouth. I am always older than you. What am I? 

-----THIRD-----
What is the order of the seasons?

-----FOURTH-----
There is one of these devices in this place. Inside it is a key to freedom that the deluded fools left here.

One last hint:
If you really want to get out of here, you must listen to me: Forever and nothing are the same. It just takes a trick of the mind to change the two.  

-----------------------------

You enter a massive spherical room. Around the center are thirty or so vats, with condensation on the sides. On the floor is a rune that looks very different from the ones you have been seeing. It consists of raised red clay that has been formed into the shape of an 8. From this are several lines of smaller less important runes which lead to the vats.

Finally, and most importantly, in the center of the room is a wooden staff. On top of it are rotating four colored orbs. Even from here, you can feel that this thing is incredibly powerful. You feel like with it you could do anything you wanted. It feels very familiar to you.
