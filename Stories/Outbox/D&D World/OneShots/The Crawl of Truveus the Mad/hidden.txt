Lamia

In front of you is a massive Lamia, the body of a woman and the tail of a snake. The woman half is quite attractive, but there is something very disturbing about the way she looks at you, as if she regards you as nothing more than food, the fact that she seems to be almost seven feet doesn't help. As she grins, you can see some very large and certainly non-human teeth. Finally, she is unarmed, but wears a set of pitch black runic plate armor which appears to have been custom built for her.  

She is restrained by a magic circle.
