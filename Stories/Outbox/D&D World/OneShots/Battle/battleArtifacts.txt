Emerald Cat's Eye
A massive half cut gem the size of a clenched fist, its cost is almost unimaginable.
However, in addition to just being expensive, it seems to have been enchanted far in the past.
Looking at something through the gem, regardless of how far it is, is like it was right beside you.
You must have line of sight to use it. You can use it an unlimited number of times.
When you use it your eyes slowly turn green.

Staff of Crushing Darkness
Casts darkness as the spell. However, in addition, those in the area must also pass a wis 15 save or be terrified (fear), specifically of the darkness, not the caster. The wielder always has partial cover in dusk or darker light.

Staff of Glorious Sunlight
Casts Daylight as the 3rd level spell. Then choose one effect: 1) all creatures in the light of the weilder's choosing gain 5 temporary hitpoints.
2) All creatures in the light of the wielder's choosing have to pass a Con save against DC 15 or be blinded.

The hollow orb
It is a large obsideon sphere which you swear is hollow.
You must pass a wisdom save. Using it will allow you to cause DCX10 feet of earth to dissapear.

The Horn of Horrid Undeath
You sacrifice an amount of HP. The horn can then cast Animate dead on a number of targets equal to the amount of HP that you sacrificed.
The undead will therefore follow the orders of whoever had the Horn in their possession.
