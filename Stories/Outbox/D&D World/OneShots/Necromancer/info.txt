Four members of a Triumverate:
Elf, imprisoned against his will. Geased into helping.
Cormeryn Ward, holder of Elf's geas. Leader of the triumverate. Harsh but fair. Former Count.
Barthalomiew Galvanus
Judith Knowles

Pre-scenario twist:
Before everyone is all together, have Barty be required to hand out the orders.
All of the members of the group live in different places. Have the players pick where they want to live.
He has to deliver order to them all.
The slots where the orders are given tell whether something has been delivered recently, only official notes are allowed in.
He notices that Judith's slot already has something in it.

The orders all say the same thing, to meet outside the cross roads at mid day.
Judith has an additional note that says "Watch out for Cormeryn. His motives are suspect. If you wish to break the illusion you must escape."

Galwell Doddle is a former caretaker
