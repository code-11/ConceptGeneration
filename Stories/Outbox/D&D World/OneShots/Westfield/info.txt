Westfield is burning. The air is dark and black from days upon days of fire. All around the once bustling city, the remains of the crops smolder in their ashes, still warm from their incineration.

The city is a horrifying lawless place. The screams of men and women are frequent, and the many civilians trapped in the conflict can do nothing more than huddle in their houses and hope for the best. 

Bands of men roam the street, and the military situation has turned chaotic. Mages spout fire, while unmarked soldiers commit horrible crimes in the muffled dead heat of the night.

-Five factions
	-Civilians
	-North
	-South + Mages
	-Collective

If part of twilight infiltrators:
- Its been two years since you met the necromancer
- Cormeryn and Judith turned on the South and are now attempting to escape.
- Barthalomiew had to be silenced somehow. Leave up to them how that was done.
- Cormeryn had proved to be a valuable ally, and has saved your life multiple times, and you him. 
- Cormeryn has mostly removed your geas and agrees to take it off completely if you help him in one last task. 
- He is holding your baby for you.
- He has a sister, the last of his family, in westfield and he needs to get her out.
- She is currently the ward of the count.

In the center of the city, and on a rise is the residence of the count.

Count's Residence

The residence is a two story wall on the top of a sudden steep hill. You can just barely see the tops of slightly taller buildings inside the stockade. The compound does not seem to have been spared fighting, and the buildings all around the stockade have been burnt to the ground.
