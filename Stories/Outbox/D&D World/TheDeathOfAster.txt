The death of Aster

Following events where Durand, Aster and Haverson foil the plans of the southern king, he sends agents after them to kill them.

One of them is a especially deadly assassin, who has a magic mask that can change his face. 

He severally wounds Haverson's arms and leg, making one of his arms unusable and kills aster, even with her training.

Haverson, knowing that only her father has the money and power to revive her, takes her back to their mansion at dor's crag.

Aster's father, the high merchant of the larouche family, is overcome with greif, much more so than his wife. 

The family chaplian is unable to revive her, and the high preist of Geremon has gone missing. 

Despite the pleas of both his wife and their business partners, he dons a unused set of golden armor and a magic sword kept in the family for generations, and vows to revive her.

They travel down together, facing the desert and bandits, and eventually the specters of the undead in the (cartaro) desert.

They make it to the fell, below which lives the Suter Queen (see suter queen notes)

She offers to reincarnate them, but warns that although the body heals, the wounds do not. 

The high merchant pleads with the suter queen and argues that Aster is worth more to him than his own life.

Because of his resolve and the fact that Aster is favored, she agrees.

Before he dies, he gives Haverson some information about her, namely that she wasn't born to the wife, and that she was actually a bastard child born to a half elf lady. Aster is a bit less than a quarter elvish.

The larouche family is furious, and banishes Aster and Haverson permanently, warning them that if they come back into Dor's crag that they will kill them. Aster is formally disowned. The mother and sons take over the family.
