Starts in media res. Two friends are getting together after a long project in school.
One of them has acquired a new type of drug which they say is amazing, or so they have been told.
They both try it leading to a very pleasant experience but one which they cant quite remember.

The next few days in school they doze off a bit.
Description of their daily lives.
Thenext time they come together they try the drug again.
This time yhey both have a bad trip filled with nonsensical visions.
Geometric patterns of indescribable colors which shoft and twist while staying still. A sense of being trapped in a dream, able to sense but not quite wht is going on around them.
Lastly a field of slightly translucebt but very sharp 3d shapes which terrifies them for some reason.

They freak out and agree to not use the drug again and have to part ways.

One of them, is worried about lasting effects, he describes that he seems to slip in and out of consciousness while remaining responsive.

At first the other doesnt understand but it gets worse until they both notice.

They both freak out.

Later though when they meet up one of them has tried to do reasearch about such things on the internet but the other seems surprisingly ok with this turn of events.
Most of life is boring and nonessestial
The fist one after the summer has, with great difficulty, reversed the effect but the other one has given in.
