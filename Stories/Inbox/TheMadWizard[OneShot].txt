Three individuals enter a dungeon.
The story starts in media res.
They go through lots of traps, each one deadlier than the last.
There is a angel and a demon both trapped in circles. They plead to the people to let them out. One is the other's illusion.
There is a fairy who appears and says they will help the adventurers, they say that they are the wizard's familiar but as things go on their memory seems less and less reliable.
Eventually they make it clear that they are just as insane as the wizard was.
Door puzzle?

They also have a very powerful magical item that was needed to open the dungeon crawl in the first place.

If one of them dies, they get ressurected. Sometimes as an undead, sometimes normally, sometimes as a spirit etc.
At the end, they jsut need to touch the phalactery.
When they do it was revealed that they were infact the mad wizards' soul being punished for what he did by having to relive his crawl again and again.
