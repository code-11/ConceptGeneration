Princess gets taken by a dragon
However there is also a batrue going on
Knight in shining armor can only choose one
Wizard uses a sPell to predict which outcome is better
Saving the princess but it clashes with the Knights utilitarian morales
The two have a philosophical argument instead of doing anything.
The princess gets eaten, the battle is lost.
