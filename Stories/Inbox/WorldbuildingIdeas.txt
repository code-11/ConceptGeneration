Worldbuilding "interesting" concepts
-Nothing in the world, geography, objects, stays in one place unless a sentient being is sensing it is some way.
-The only sentient creatures in the world are ancient artifacts, which posses humanoid bodies in order to "live"
-There is only one city, a massive towering thing surrounded on all side by a void. No one knows what happens if you step through the void. Every so often, the void moves closer inward.
-The only resource and material type in the world is bone. The ground, houses, all things are are not living is bone. Vegetation is calcite deposits. The planet itself is bone, skeletons of monstrous creatures, most dead, all the way through. 
-It is possible to enter another person's head, physically entering another world that reflects that person. You can learn about them in this manner but can't mess with anything inception style. If you find a particular object(s) you can get out. The problem is that it is recursive: you can enter another person's head in another person's head and so forth. Perhaps there is no "normal level". Perhaps there exists a normal level but people are unsure that maybe they just can't find the objects needed to leave. 
-One race in the world is clearly extradimensional, or extra planetary invaders/pilgrims/refugees/traders with crazy high tech. Why doesn't this break things? District 9 pulled it off...
-Your life force and strength is determined by how much money you have. If you run out, you die.
-All objects except for sentient beings are elementally aspected (as decided by rule of cool I guess?) in kind of a Feng shui like system. Perhaps the elemental interactions are more complicated than rock paper scissors (ie fire strengthens rock but changes the form of wind) 
-Everyone is Samson, your power is determined by your hair length. Hair only grows as normal! Old people are like crazy powerful.
-The world exists in only light and darkness. If you go into the darkness, anywhere, you start to go insane. People keep never ending pyres. Adventuring in dungeons is even more risky.
-The world is a cylinder and it is possible, with enough force, the propel oneself through the hollow center where the sun is. Perhaps nations can attack one another from "above"! Holy dimensional combat batman!
-Everyone can become gods, you simply have to have enough people believe in you. Demi gods fight for control of cultists favor.
-Souls are completely visible and you can use them as currency or to guarentee trade deals.
-There are no humans, only undead. The plane itself is hell? 
-There is no land anywhere, either as a giant ocean, or floating rocks.  
-You only live as long as you are moving
-Every morning you awake as another person.
