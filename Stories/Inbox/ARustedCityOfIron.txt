An average person stares and watches as a nuclear attack goes off in a city.
Several bombs falling, each one distinguishable in the sky
The sound of the military plane
The sight of the counter missiles attempting to stop the attack
Several are destroyed causing a false alarm
Person hides in a basement bathtub
Everyone else is less fortunate

Hundreds of years later, the city is a sprawlng monstrosity of scrap metal and decay
The old buildings built ontop off by the citizens an attempt to out build the decay from the bottom
The buildings are a crazy collection of ship hulls, fine stone from monuments, and scrap
However, at night, creatures move in the shadows, stange monkey like things that like to explore openings.
Becasue of this and the acid rain, everything looks inward.
People only interact with their "families" and those closest to them that can trade for nessesaties.

The greatest hope of everyone living in the city is to escape the damned planet into space, but the cost is astronomically high.
In order to substitute, every once and a while, they utilize massive hydraulics to move their building sections closer to the sky.
