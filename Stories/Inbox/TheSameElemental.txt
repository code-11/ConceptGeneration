Typical d&d setting
A apprentice mage is taught how to summon some type of elemental
After doing this anumber of times he becomes convinced that the elemental is the same one each time
Perhaps he notices some physical characteristic about the elemental, or its behavior.
Regardless, he attempts to communicate with it 
Somewhat of a mystery-esque procedural investigation thing. Using the rules of magic to force the elemental to take actions that would identify it.
Possible twist. It is the same but its actions are part of a much larger eldrith intellegence which is meaning to burst out into the world.
