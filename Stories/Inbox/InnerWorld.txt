The world is a giant Dyson sphere like habitat.
In the center, instead of a star there is a massive reactor.
Possibly other satilites to provide night and day.
Above you you can see the rest of the world.
Perhaps the shere is flattened somewhat.

You can travel through the center with an aircraft but it has to be built and navigated well.
Rockets can also traverse the gap, maybe artillery as well.

Warring factions try to take bipolar areas so you can't she'll from above.
Or have the opposing side be a desert or a mountain.
Otherside

People inside have never seen space.
Perhaps protected from some galactic tragedy.
The conept of emptiness is horrifying to them.
