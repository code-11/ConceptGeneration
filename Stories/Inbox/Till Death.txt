Till Death
-man dies and becomes a skeleton
-because of bog where he was buried and comes back to life
-wife is alone and hears him wants to come back to house
-discuss whether or not this is going to work
  -practical problems like people freaking out
  -lack of physical relationship
  -can never have children
  -Both can theoretically live forever together
    -But perhaps people aren't meant to live that long with someone
    -Might be worse that what little we had by making it so long 
  -against god
  -don't have to eat, could go anywhere
  -Wife doesn't want to kill herself to join husband
  -Skeleton life is arbitrary, what if it just stops? Same applies to wife.
