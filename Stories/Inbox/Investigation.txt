A young detective is assigned to a murder case for the first time
Dutifully he starts to record everything about the case and tries to come to his own conclusions
The case itself is halariously contrived, such as would only happen in a video game
A veteran police officer tell s the young detective that he shouldn't think too hard about things because the senior detective is a genius.
True to his word, the senior detective arrives and quickly understands and 'solves' the case.
Flabbergasted and somewhat put out, the junior detective goes back to the station.

Meanwhile, when everyone else leaves, the senior detective plants the last crucial peice of evidense that would absolve himself of the crime.

The case is as follows, a man in his early thirties is found dead in his bed, by multiple gunshot wounds at close range.
The idea is that the neighbor's wife was cheating on him with the current murdered.
The neighbor was perhaps a disgruntled ex-military person with a history of violence.
