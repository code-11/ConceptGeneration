Out in the future, maybe 50 years. mankind has spread tothe stars.
however, coflict remains.
basically a thought peice on how war has vhanged and how it will change.
most of human history, war was based on direct confrontation of armies and armed forces. 
however with the invention of nuclear weapons, that has chnged. for now there is jot great power conflict, at least not openly.
howver in the future, network attacks and other hacking is fair game, allowing for more direct confrontation
it would be a war of spies, information, hacking, ai and programing.

in space its too easy to destroy everything. so this form of warfare is perfect for near future extra planar conflict
