A astronaught think about how much she likes running while on the moon.
She gets a communication from the base, located on the dark side, that there has been a one in one billion event, two commets have collided with one another in the vecinity of earth.
This has altered both of their trajectories.
She comes back at their insistance but finds the base destroyed by fragments of the collision.
She does out the trajectory, or remembers what they told her and realizes that the next cycle will put it on a collision with earth.
The comm is broken so she has to run to a smaller base nearby.
She is able to send the transmition and realizes that there is no way to deflect the object. Earth is doomed.

After an appropriate amount of reflection, she switches off her comms and takes all the remaining food to the beta base. 
Because everyone else is dead she has all their food and can last a long time. But there is nothing to do, and she can't run.
