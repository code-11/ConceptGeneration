Emotions are a zero sum game. 
There exists two classes of society where one class is the only ones affording joy. 
Because the lower classes are so joyless, they don't have kids, so there is a constant flow from the joyful down to the crushed. 
All the more horrifying because the joyful have previously known nothing but Joy.

When people die, they release their emotions back into the population.
