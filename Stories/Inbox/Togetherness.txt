	• A group of young people are entering an underground facility
	• It becomes clear that the world has been wracked by a horrible disaster of global proportions and perhaps more
	• A group of 'aliens' or advanced humans comes to the earth and 'helps' humans?
		○ Leaves the whole race broken and empty
		○ Scars the earth with 'toxogenic radiation'
	• They move through the facility which was constructed by earlier human civilizations
	• Three main characters
		○ Cio- Female, Scientist whose goal is the advancement of technology and more broadly the human race= "Make something new onto the world".
		○ Aralim - Male, Hard worker. History buff. In relationship with Cio. People are what is important in the world; quality.
		○ Alexa - Female, Team leader, perhaps older. Probably dies first. Wants to reverse the damage done to humans. People are important to the world, but only in number: quantity.
		○ There might be followers but they don't need to play a huge part.
	• They move deeper into the facility but Alexa wont tell them exaclty what they are there for.
	• Alexa and probably some of the others get killed. It could be due to a trap. It could be a rival group of humans.
	• Eventually they come across a Stalker.
		○ The Stalkers are massive bio mechanical insectoid things which hunt humans
		○ They have an amazing sense of 'smell' and react badly to fear, anger and other negative emotions
		○ Perhaps it also kills some of them as an example of what it can do.
		○ Cio is unphased by it, due to being a Child, born after the cataclism, she has some innate connection to it.
		○ After being hunted by it for a while, she agrees to stop it, eventually gets inside it, jams control rod into its brain after cutting herself. 
		○ It dies, but releases a bunch of spider drones
	• Maybe Cio dies here?
	• Cio reapprears physically as the spider drone which was born from her efforts, and a hard light image projected from it.
	• They get to the final door but can't open it. Too hollow to do so.
	• Spider drone Cio and Aralim bond; both lose their individuality: a meld of man and machine, man and woman, alive and dead. They're then able to open up the door.
	• Inside is one of the aliens, still there from the conflict. 
	• "You were always with us!" Gets ripped apart by radiation or perhaps transcends.
