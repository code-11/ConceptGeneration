Young man goes running at night
At first the air is nice and he decides to go further than he has in the past
He was supposed to meet friends but they bailed at the last minute
It is very dark since its in the winter
As he runs, he goes past the point where he normally turns around.
He keeps on going down into a dense forest, and all he has is his headlamp to see by
He starts hearing things but things its just his own footsteps.
Gets more and mroe freaked out
Running by a pond, things start to move in the underbrush
What is he going to do, run faster? He's already running fast!
The things grab him...
