-It is the far future.
-Mankind has developed Mind Machine Interfaces.
-Horrified by their initial use, they are instantly banned with enforcement done by heavy orbital scan and energy analysis.
-However, out on the asteroid belt they imprison inmates and use MMI to have the criminals give back to society.
-They operate by the 80/20 rule. 80 percent of their mind is used as processing by the massive bio computer, 10 is used to create a shared illusion to keep them complacent. 10 is left to the inmates to explore this shared illusion.
-The main character is the investigator, who has been sent by the central government to investigate alligations that the prisoners are being abused.
-The main rules are that the system must be explained to the inmates.
-The illusion is introduced gently.
-Eventually it feel like falling to a heavy abyss; a slowness.

-Things get more and more strange around the prison and the investigator believes he has been poisoned.
-Ends with the investigator being blown out an airlock with a feeling of dread. Was he in the system the whole time?
-Or were they all in on it and conspired against?
