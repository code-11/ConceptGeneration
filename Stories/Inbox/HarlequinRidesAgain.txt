Harlequin rides again

The world has progressed to the point where overpopulation and resource depletion have forced them to contain the last of the human race into dense super cities
In order to mitigate the effect of so many people on infrastructure, the city is divided into many segments.
However, these division are only theoretical, there is no wall yet. 

The Harlequin, a rebel fighting for the chaotic and artistic nature of mankind wants to break down the limitations on people interacting. 
Inspector Natasha is a government agent assigned as half psycho analyist half policewaomn to try to keep this person under control.

They talk a lot about the philosophy of the city and the sociology inherent in having a population's actions constrained just so that a simulation can help them.
