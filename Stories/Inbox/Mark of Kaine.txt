Person wanders through the desert
Finds a town and eagerly runs to it
The people all treat him with disgust and horror
Above his head it the mark of Kaine (biblical sense)
They can't hurt him so they carry him outside of town with forked staves
He wanders more and starts dying of thirst
Sees bonfire/sandstorm
Walks to it.
Horror to see massive tablets
Not my time!
Tries to run but breath draws him back
Fist from the heavens kills him
Sees angel and dies
