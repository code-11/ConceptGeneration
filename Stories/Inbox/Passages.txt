Someone goes into an old coal mine and becomes lost.
The tight knit community must save them
They have a map but once inside everything looks the same
Concern that she fell down a shaft
Lots of people go in to look for her, but they themselves have trouble getting out
Passages look the same
Odd sounds
Ropes mysteriously sever
Find old remains
Lights appear (perhaps looking like miners/cavers lights)
Passages appear not on the map
