The world is at crisis during the cold war
Both sides are at very high levels of alert
Only growing more and more confrontational by the day
Suddenly a problem breaks out aboard one of the submarines 
The side assumes the worst and goes to provoke
Things turn hot
Nukes are going to be launched

Aliens come in and blow up all the launched weapons
Open the pod bay dors Jerry!
Explain that humans are actually in the terratorial expanse of a massive stellar empire
They have been ok with the humans doing whatever they want up until now but they won't let them destroy the earth or themselves.
