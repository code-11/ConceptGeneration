The under pits of <>:
Repressed for centuries of unending servitude, the peoples of <> lived horrible tortured lives.
The land was sick and dead, the brutal sun setting literal fire to the surface.
Underneath this cracked and broken crust lay the caverns, the only habitable area, dug eons ago by a force so ancient as to have been forgotten.

Under harsh rule, the populace endless mines new tunnels, twisting reaching into the earth below, many times filling these new chasm with their own bodies, as their strength gives out.

The masters of <> are the Taskseers of the Oversong, the immortal enclave of opulence and oppression.
Under their brutal fist, they maintain mind ensnaring magics that keep the populace their complete, if unwilling, slaves. 
Although the masters hate for one another is well known, and their fractious conflicts had made the halls echo with the screams of the innocent, they all had to work together to perform the Oversong, a ritual of pure good.

The ritual, also devised in times long forgotten, once brought life and nourishment to all who dwelled in <>, but long ago, the Taskseers, collaborating in secret had devised an addendum to the ritual, that turned its power not out onto the land but inwards onto the practicers. With this power they had subjugated the rest of the populace.   

The year has now come to a close and it is time for the Oversung to once again ring through the ears of the enslaved. But this time it is different, a group of slaves positioned accidently too close to the ritual finds themselves free of their enchantment. Their minds are free and they find their bodies strong. With this new found freedom they think of one thing only: vengeance.
