Basically just a riff on guns germs steel only looking at aliens recent conquest of Earth.
Perhaps guile, genetics, spacecraft.

Comparison of Earth with alien home world and another conquered race. Conquered race had a huge planet, thick atmosphere. Developed flight early but no spacecraft.

Guile- The aliens came in small numbers to scout out. Made deals with Russia, NAP with China. Did not reveal true intentions. Contrast to flag on moon.

Genetics- Aliens grew on a small world with less magnetic sheilding. More mutations, more  noticable. Contrast with medleson. 

Spacecraft - planet was smaller so less resources and less mass. More reason to leave and easier to do so. Contrast to lots of theoretically habitable areas in our Galaxy.
