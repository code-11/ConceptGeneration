Near a particularly nasty fen called ____irons
Blind woman named Merida insists that she has felt angels nearby.
Town is religious
Man accompanies her
Night falls
Angels come out
They are angels but of what god?
Realizes with horror that she's never seen them
She drags him closer as he sees her body nearby
