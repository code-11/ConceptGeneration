-As mankind expanded outward into the galaxy, things looked good.
-However, intense solar storms ruin communication etc. (The whole 40k stars without number trick)
-Survivors out in the far rim in space stations
-The spae stations are huge as they held a large amount of humanity
-Strange sightings in the illused parts of the stations
-Space with ghosts
-There is nothing out here but us and us.
