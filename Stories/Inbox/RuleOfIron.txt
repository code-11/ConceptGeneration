You are part of a military dictatorship.
The leader is the inscrutable powerhpuse, possessing superhuman intellegence.
He basically doesn't need anyone to run the country but abides everyone else for the spectacle.
Him and his lead engineer build mega projects.
You are the head of the navy/airforce, and constantly try to do a good job but always fail him.

The enemy is very tricky and possesses good tech as well, think culture.
May be shapeshiftera.

A problem arises when everyone learns that, either through simulation or real combat, that their tech has out performed yours.
You are learn that the engineer is a spy and that the head guy knew about it all the time.

For once you feel like you have the chancestors to do something worthwhile.
