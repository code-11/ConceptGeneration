An astronought and perhaps another one come across a distress becon on an lien planet
Their ship crash lands but they both survive
As they explore they find hints of the ruins of a civilization
They start seeing illusions of themselves when they were younger
They follow them deeper and deeper
Come across a sealed door
Somehow they know the password
Go inside and find a machine and turn it on
Sends them back in time to when they were younger on the planet
