Man has trouble sleeping.
Takes new experimental drug given to him by untrustworthy doctor.
Fig story.
Experiences increasingly disturbing night terrors.
Perhaps some chemical imbalance in brain.
Believes wrongness is coming into him world.
Lies awake-asleep wrong position, room I'd wrong, toss and turn.
More things start becoming wrong in real life following pattern in dream.
Small holes that are sharp
The world twisted
Red eyes glowing in the dark
The sense that constrains are violated.
