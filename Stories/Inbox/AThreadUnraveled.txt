Fantasy world, could possibly be the founders from the d&d world. 
Magic is approached in a scientific manner
One job is essentially a programmer, called a sequencer. They have to envoke spells in complicated configurations in order to achieve some desired effect.
However, since one person can acumulate lots of power himself, society has developed different.
Assasinations are common

Worst spell is one that cancels a person, past present and future. 
The system tries to make up for the absense of the person by erasing their actions through time and getting rid of all their effects.
People don't even know that the spell exists because if you used it, you no longer have a reason to learn it. 
Programmer deduces its existance.
The problem is that you can never figure out when or who cast it, or whom it was cast on, since no one has memories of the event.
Obviously though, such an effect has massive implications and majorly destabilizes the universe. 

Bulk of the story is the sequencer trying to figure out what exactly happened.
Learns abou the effects of the spell and tries to convince people of it.
