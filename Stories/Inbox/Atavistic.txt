-Among them are two men and a woman.
-This is set in the 20s or some similar period
-They are investigating some african savanna ruins
-One of the men is interested in the woman but she isn't in him. 
-However, since its the 20s he is being pretty pushy about it.
-The other man is a efficient if timid administrator.
