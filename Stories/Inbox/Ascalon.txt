Person lying in bed.
Dreaming about a thing called salon technical univeraity.
Dreams all end prematurely with a horrible sense of being atched.
A face made up of digital static.
The presence  of someone without seeing them.
Every time transported back to their bed.
They try to write the idea down but their vision fades and the cursor goes wild.
The being has been in the room all this time.alternates between calm and fucking terrified.
He is not allowed to writw it down.
There is some sort of knowledge about a daughter.
Fish in a tub, random unrelated hallucinations that end in terror.
