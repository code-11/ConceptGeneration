Affections Across Time Â· Wolf and Raven
"Amazing track. Looking at the title and listening to this makes me think it tells the story of the Cyber Samurai before being cyberised, before his failed assassination attempt on him but only managed to almost kill him but ended in only killing his lover as collateral. But he has been given a second chance to get revenge."
