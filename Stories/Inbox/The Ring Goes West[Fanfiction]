-*Frodo succums to his wounds in rivendell 
-Council of Elrond, Elphir, sone of the prince of Dol Amroth, is present instead of boromir.
-Boromir is needed to repel the orcs at osgiliath.
-Elphir suggests taking the ring to gondor, as Boromir does, but is shut down.
-Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf agree that it is now impossible to have the ring enter mordor unseen.
	-To take it closer to the enemy would be madness.
	-Thus, it can no longer be truly destroyed.
	-Instead, they suggest it be brought to Alan where the Valar can unmake it, or failing that, be brought as far out over the ocean as possible, possibly to the rift formed by the destruction of Al Phazaron's fleet, and cast it into the depths. Has precedent in the simirils. 

-Land journey
	-Aragon is met by the shade of the witch king (as his body was destroyed by the waters entering rivendell), who, using the palantir, shows him a reborn north, where Aragon has brought together the rest of the dunadain.
	-The witch king cannot cause trouble in this area as part of the dual prophesy, but he can talk to people. 
	-Argues that with Arnor reborn, there would exist a kingdom of strength necessary to challenge mordor.
	-He is the last king of Arnor by conquest, but Aragon is the true king.
	-He pleads with Aragon to take his ring and banish him, as the true king has power over the shades of death.
	-Aragon does not agree but is shaken by the encounter and the words of the nazgul stick in his mind.
	-*Later he is visited by the shade of frodo who has become a ring wraith himself. Frodo pleads with Aragon to protect the shire.

	-These two factors together tip the scales enough so that aragorn tries to take the ring from the hobbits. 
	-Disturbed and frightened the fellowship breaks as it does originally on the river, with Aragorn falling to trolls and orcs out of angband and gundabad (who may not actually being controlled by the witch king), with the ring of barahir passed to someone else, maybe legolas.
	-This ring is then given or shown to the cheifton of the Lossoth in exchange for free passage and ships. 

-Other elements include:
	- A kraken
	- A forced detour onto the HelcaraxÃ« (caused by kraken?)
		-An attack by the frozen remains of the flight of the noldor?
		-An attack by the king of the ice drakes -> if this, mirrors the battle between gandalf and the balrog, with gandalf splitting the ice
